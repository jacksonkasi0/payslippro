-- COMPREHENSIVE RLS POLICY FIX
-- This script drops ALL existing policies and creates simple working ones
-- Run this directly in Supabase SQL Editor

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES
-- ============================================

-- Organizations table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Drop all existing policies on organizations
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access their organization" ON organizations;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow INSERT for authenticated users" ON organizations;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their organization" ON organizations;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their organization" ON organizations;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their organization" ON organizations;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON organizations;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Admin Users table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access admin users in their org" ON admin_users;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to create their admin profile" ON admin_users;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage admin users in their org" ON admin_users;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update admin users in their org" ON admin_users;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete admin users in their org" ON admin_users;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON admin_users;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Departments table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access departments in their org" ON departments;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON departments;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Positions table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access positions in their org" ON positions;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON positions;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Employees table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access employees in their org" ON employees;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON employees;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Attendance table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access attendance in their org" ON attendance;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON attendance;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Payslips table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access payslips in their org" ON payslips;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON payslips;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Payslip Emails table

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON payslip_emails;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- PDF Configs table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access PDF configs in their org" ON pdf_configs;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON pdf_configs;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: CREATE NEW SIMPLE WORKING POLICIES
-- ============================================

-- Organizations: Allow all authenticated users (temporary for signup to work)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON organizations
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Admin Users: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON admin_users
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Departments: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON departments
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Positions: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON positions
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Employees: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON employees
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Attendance: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON attendance
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Payslips: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON payslips
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Payslip Emails: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON payslip_emails
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- PDF Configs: Allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything" ON pdf_configs
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: VERIFY POLICIES ARE APPLIED
-- ============================================
DO $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'All RLS policies have been reset successfully!';
    RAISE NOTICE 'Signup should now work properly.';
    RAISE NOTICE 'Remember to tighten security policies for production use.';
